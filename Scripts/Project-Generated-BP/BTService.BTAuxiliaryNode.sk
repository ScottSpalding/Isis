// Behavior Tree service nodes is designed to perform "background" tasks that update AI's knowledge.
// 
// Services are being executed when underlying branch of behavior tree becomes active,
// but unlike tasks they don't return any results and can't directly affect execution flow.
// 
// Usually they perform periodical checks (see TickNode) and often store results in blackboard.
// If any decorator node below requires results of check beforehand, use OnSearchStart function.
// Keep in mind that any checks performed there have to be instantaneous!
// 
// Other typical use case is creating a marker when specific branch is being executed
// (see OnBecomeRelevant, OnCeaseRelevant), by setting a flag in blackboard.
// 
// Because some of them can be instanced for specific AI, following virtual functions are not marked as const:
// - OnBecomeRelevant (from UBTAuxiliaryNode)
// - OnCeaseRelevant (from UBTAuxiliaryNode)
// - TickNode (from UBTAuxiliaryNode)
// - OnSearchStart
// 
// If your node is not being instanced (default behavior), DO NOT change any properties of object within those functions!
// Template nodes are shared across all behavior tree components using the same tree asset and must store
// their runtime properties in provided NodeMemory block (allocation size determined by GetInstanceMemorySize() )
//
// UE4 name of this class: BTService
